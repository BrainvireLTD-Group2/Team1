## How do I compile an executable file?
You can use the following tools to download all the GitHub projects and compile them into an executable:

## DownloadEverything.bash
Will download everything from the GitHub and move it into one working directory "Ufix-Program". You will need to run this in ***Git Bash*** as it *will **NOT*** work in the Windows command line.

To use this script use the command `bash DownloadEverything.bash` provided you are in the directory where the DownloadEverything file is located.



## BuildTools
Is a C# executable that will take the working directory "Ufix-Program" that is created when **DownloadEverything.bash** is ran. This will then compile and create a portable executable that will run as a silent Python interpreter.

Once downloaded, just run the .exe file and the help screens will guide you through the building process.
