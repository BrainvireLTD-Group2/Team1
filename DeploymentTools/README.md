## How do I compile an executable file?
You can use the following tools to download all the GitHub projects and compile them into an executable:

## DownloadEverything.bash
Will download everything from the GitHub and move it into one working directory "Ufix-Program". You will need to run this in ***Git Bash*** as it *will **NOT*** work in the Windows command line.

To use this script use the command `bash DownloadEverything.bash` provided you are in the directory where the DownloadEverything file is located.
