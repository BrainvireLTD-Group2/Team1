## How do I compile an executable file?
You can use the following tools to download all the GitHub projects and compile them into an executable:

## UFIXSetup.bash
Will download everything from the GitHub and move it into one working directory "sources" and create an executable called UFIX.exe. You will need to run this in ***Git Bash*** as it *will **NOT*** work in the Windows command line.

To use this script use the command `bash UFIXSetup.bash` provided you are in the directory where the UFIXSetup.bash file is located.

***
Once everything has finished downloading using UFIXSetup.bash, you can launch the program using the UFIX.exe file.
